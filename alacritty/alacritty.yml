hints:
#   Keys used for the hint labels.
#   alphabet: "jfkdls;ahgurieowpq"

#   List with all available hints
  
#   Each hint must have a `regex` and either an `action` or a `command` field.
#   The fields `mouse`, `binding` and `post_processing` are optional.
  
#   The fields `command`, `binding.key`, `binding.mods`, `binding.mode` and
#   `mouse.mods` accept the same values as they do in the `key_bindings` section.
  
#   The `mouse.enabled` field controls if the hint should be underlined while
#   the mouse with all `mouse.mods` keys held or the vi mode cursor is above it.
  
#   If the `post_processing` field is set to `true`, heuristics will be used to
#   shorten the match if there are characters likely not to be part of the hint
#   (e.g. a trailing `.`). This is most useful for URIs.
  
#   Values for `action`:
#     - Copy
#         Copy the hint's text to the clipboard.
#     - Paste
#         Paste the hint's text to the terminal or search.
#     - Select
#         Select the hint's text.
#     - MoveViModeCursor
#         Move the vi mode cursor to the beginning of the hint.
